                            <p>A checking account is designed for frequent transactions, and you can use your money in a variety of ways.</p>

                            <p>A debit card is a payment card that makes payment by deducting money directly from a consumerâ€™s checking account, rather than via loan from a bank. Debit cards offer the convenience of credit cards and many of the same consumer protections when issued by major payment processors like Visa or MasterCard.</p>
